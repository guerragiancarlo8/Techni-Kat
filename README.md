TECHNIKAT

This small-scale web application was developed using the Flask Python microframework and the Bloomberg Open API. It received best business/finance hack using Bloomberg's Open API in HackRU 2014. 

The idea behind TechniKat is to allow users with no business/finance knowledge to delve into the world of investing. The application achieves this by guiding the user on the basic principles of technical analysis. The application addresses the problem of initial intimidation: Many investment tools out there have complicated GUI's that display almost hyeroglyphical information that scares off many novices from the market. TechniKat addresses this by creating an interactive and simple web interfase that maximizes learning and reduces intimidation. The application queries financial data from the Bloomberg API database and, using pygal, generates interactive line charts with the information. 

At it's current state, the application will not work because it lacks a renewed API key(Which cost money!). Feel free to contact any of the developers for more information!
